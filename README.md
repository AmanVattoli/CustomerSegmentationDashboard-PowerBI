## Project Overview

This **Customer Segmentation Dashboard** offers a detailed analysis of customer purchasing behavior using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** segmentation. The original purchase dataset, which includes transaction-level data such as purchase amounts and dates, was analyzed to derive the RFM dataset. This transformation involved scoring customers based on how recently they made a purchase (Recency), how frequently they made purchases (Frequency), and their total spending (Monetary). The dashboard uses these RFM scores to segment customers into categories that drive strategic decision-making for personalized marketing and retention initiatives.

### Data Exploration and Cleaning

The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis through the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified missing values, outliers, and overall distribution of data.
2. **RFM Segmentation**: Customers were segmented based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics to identify key customer groups.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed inconsistencies.

### **Key Features:**
- **KPIs:** Total Customers, Average Purchases, Average Order Value, Recency Score, Frequency Score, and Monetary Score.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Treemap visualization of customer groups like Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, and New Customers.
- **Revenue Contribution by Segment:** Identifies which customer segments generate the most revenue.
- **Customer Value Distribution:** Histogram of customers based on their RFM Score.
- **Top Customers Table:** Lists high-value customers based on spending and RFM Score.
- **Interactive Filtering:** Dropdown selection to filter insights by Customer Segment.
